## Introduction

CoreBlocks is going to be an out-of-order processor which will implement a RISC-V microarchitecture.
The project will focus on flexibility, which should allow to easily make experiments with different
component implementations.

## Documentation

Documentation located in the `docs/` directory collects description of the whole processor.
In `Overview` a high level overview of CoreBlocks can be found.
