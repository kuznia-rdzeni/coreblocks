# Coreblocks in Renode (via Verilator)

Code based on [`verilated_ibex.resc`](https://github.com/renode/renode/blob/master/scripts/single-node/verilated_ibex.resc) and official Renode samples from https://github.com/antmicro/renode-verilator-integration

Unfortunately needs Renode built from source, does not work in installed environment (https://github.com/renode/renode/issues/726).

Does not work yet, hangs on setting PC to 0 (no debug interface).
