# Coreblocks

Coreblocks is an experimental, modular out-of-order [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/specifications/) core generator implemented in [Amaranth](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth/). Its design goals are:

 * Simplicity. Coreblocks is an academic project, accessible to students.
   It should be suitable for teaching essentials of out-of-order architectures.
 * Modularity. We want to be able to easily experiment with the core by adding, replacing and modifying modules without changing the source too much.
   For this goal, we designed a transaction system called [Transactron](https://github.com/kuznia-rdzeni/transactron), which is inspired by [Bluespec](http://wiki.bluespec.com/).
 * Fine-grained testing. Outside of the integration tests for the full core, modules are tested individually.
   This is to support an agile style of development.

In the future, we would like to achieve the following goals:

 * Performance (up to a point, on FPGAs). We would like Coreblocks not to be too sluggish, without compromising the simplicity goal.
   We don't wish to compete with high performance cores like [BOOM](https://github.com/riscv-boom/riscv-boom) though.
 * Wide(r) RISC-V support. Currently, we are focusing on getting the support for the core RV32I ISA right, but the ambitious long term plan is to be able to run full operating systems (e.g. Linux) on the core.

## State of the project

The core currently supports the full RV32I instruction set and several extensions, including M (multiplication and division) and C (compressed instructions).
Exceptions and some of machine-mode CSRs are supported, the support for interrupts is currently rudimentary and incompatible with the RISC-V spec.
Coreblocks can be used with [LiteX](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex) (currently using a [patched version](https://github.com/kuznia-rdzeni/litex/tree/coreblocks)).

## Documentation

The [documentation for our project](https://kuznia-rdzeni.github.io/coreblocks/) is automatically generated using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

Resource usage and maximum clock frequency is [automatically measured and recorded](https://kuznia-rdzeni.github.io/coreblocks/dev/benchmark/).
