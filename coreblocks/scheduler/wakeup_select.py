class WakeupSelect(Elaboratable):
    """
    Simple Wakeup Select unit.
    Works by firstly getting readiness vector from the method `get_ready` (it is a binary vector,
    where 1 on i-th position means i-th row is ready to be taken and 0 means it is not). In next
    step if any row is ready to be taken it calls `take_row` with i (position of last ready row)
    as an argument in order to get its value and then calls method `issue` with i-th row as
    argument. It is prepared to work with RS and functional unit interfaces.
