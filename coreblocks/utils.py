def assign(lhs: Signal | Record, rhs: ValueLike, *, fields: AssignFields = AssignType.RHS) -> Iterable[Assign]:
    """Safe record assignment.

    This function generates assignment statements for records and reports
    errors in case of mismatch. If either of ``lhs`` or ``rhs`` is not
    a Record, checks for the same bit width and generates a single
    assignment statement.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lhs : Record or Signal
        Record or signal being assigned.
    rhs : Record or Value-castable
        Record or signal containing assigned values.
    fields : AssignType or Iterable or Mapping, optional
        Determines which fields will be assigned. Possible values:

        AssignType.COMMON
            Only fields common to ``lhs`` and ``rhs`` are assigned.
        AssignType.RHS
            All fields in ``rhs`` are assigned. If one of them is not present
            in ``lhs``, an exception is raised.
        AssignType.ALL
            Assume that both records have the same layouts. All fields present
            in ``lhs`` or ``rhs`` are assigned.
        Mapping
            Keys are field names, values follow the format for ``fields``.
        Iterable
            Items are field names. For subrecords, AssignType.ALL is assumed.

    Returns
    -------
    Iterable[Assign]
        Generated assignment statements.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the assignment can't be safely performed.
