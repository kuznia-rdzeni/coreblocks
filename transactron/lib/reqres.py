class ArgumentsToResultsZipper(Elaboratable):
    """Zips arguments used to call method with results, cutting critical path.

    This module provides possibility to pass arguments from caller and connect it with results
    from callee. Arguments are stored in 2-FIFO and results in Forwarder. Because of this asymmetry,
    the callee should provide results as long as they aren't correctly received.

    FIFO is used as rate-limiter, so when FIFO reaches full capacity there should be no new requests issued.

    Example topology:

    .. mermaid::

        graph LR
            Caller -- write_arguments --> 2-FIFO;
            Caller -- invoke --> Callee["Callee \\n (1+ cycle delay)"];
            Callee -- write_results --> Forwarder;
            Forwarder -- read --> Zip;
            2-FIFO -- read --> Zip;
            Zip -- read --> User;
            subgraph ArgumentsToResultsZipper

    responses from the server are in-order, so the order of responses is the same as order of requests.
